# Week 3

An image that would be received or perceived differently if it were seen in another medium would be pictures from salespeople after they close a deal. Many people in sales will take a picture with their client after making a sale to show on their social media that they are successful in what they do. Seen out of context, these pictures would just look like someone was taking pictures with a bunch of random people that you would be left wondering how they knew or what their connection to them was. Perhaps they enjoy taking photos with strangers on a regular basis. This type of image contains written language, a cultural component and the objects/framing in the image.

In my particular image it would be a written caption, the closeness of the people in the image (in the western world, we may put our arm around a client or shake their hand) and then the people in the photo and how they would be the focus.
